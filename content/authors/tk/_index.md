I am a masters student at the University of Alberta with an interest in Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I obtained my BSc from Tel Aviv University in 2019, where I worked with Professor Nachum Dershowitz on various Digital Humanities projects (see publications). In 2019, I joined the University of Alberta as a masters student, supervised by Professor Li Cheng. I am currently working on medical report generation, and video summarization. When I am not working, I like running, making jokes, and playing video games (usually not simultaneously).
